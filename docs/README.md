## Key Concepts

### What is Seal?
Seal is a threshold encryption protocol that enables:
- **Client-side encryption** - Data encrypted in browser
- **Distributed key management** - No single point of failure
- **Onchain access control** - Blockchain verifies permissions
- **Zero-knowledge decryption** - Storage layer never sees plaintext

### What is Walrus?
Walrus is a decentralized storage network that provides:
- **Blob storage** - Store encrypted files
- **Erasure coding** - Data redundancy
- **Decentralized** - No single storage provider
- **Cost-effective** - Pay per epoch

### What is Sui?
Sui is a Layer 1 blockchain that offers:
- **Move language** - Safe smart contracts
- **Object-centric** - Everything is an object
- **Parallel execution** - High throughput
- **Low latency** - Fast finality

## Quick Start

### 1. Set Up Environment
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/vmmuthu31/Sui-CRM.git
cd Sui-CRM

# Install dependencies
cd web
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your values
```

### 2. Deploy Contracts
```bash
cd contracts/sui_crm
sui move build
sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000

# Copy package ID and update web/lib/config/contracts.ts
```

### 3. Run Frontend
```bash
cd web
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

### 4. Test Encryption Flow
1. Create organization
2. Add team member
3. Create contact profile
4. Add encrypted note
5. Try to decrypt as different roles

## Use Cases

### 1. Community to Onchain Conversion Tracking
**Scenario:** Track Discord users who mint NFTs

**Flow:**
1. Create profile for Discord user (public)
2. Link wallet address when they connect (public)
3. Track Discord interactions (public)
4. Track onchain mints/stakes (public)
5. Add internal notes about engagement strategy (encrypted)

### 2. VC Deal Management
**Scenario:** Track investor relationships

**Flow:**
1. Create profile for VC firm (public)
2. Add contact person's socials (public)
3. Upload pitch deck (encrypted - Admins only)
4. Add negotiation notes (encrypted - Admins only)
5. Track token allocation (encrypted - Admins only)

### 3. Whale Tracking
**Scenario:** Monitor high-value users

**Flow:**
1. Create profile for whale wallet (public)
2. Track onchain activity (public)
3. Add internal tag "VIP" (encrypted)
4. Add strategy notes (encrypted - Managers+)
5. Upload partnership agreement (encrypted - Admins only)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
- Always verify you're on the correct domain
- Review transaction details before signing
- Use hardware wallet for high-value operations
- Set appropriate access levels for sensitive data
- Regularly review team member permissions

### For Developers
- Never log decrypted data
- Clear session keys after use
- Validate all user inputs
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
- Audit smart contracts before deployment

## Troubleshooting

### Encryption Fails
**Problem:** `encryptAndUploadResource` returns error

**Solutions:**
1. Check Walrus publishers are accessible
2. Verify Seal key servers are online (4 servers, threshold of 2)
3. Ensure org registry ID is correct
4. Check file size limits

### Decryption Fails
**Problem:** `downloadAndDecryptResources` returns "Access Denied"

**Solutions:**
1. Verify user has sufficient role (Viewer=1, Manager=2, Admin=3)
2. Check if user is registered in OrgAccessRegistry
3. Ensure session key is valid
4. Verify EncryptedResource object is immutable (frozen) on-chain

### Transaction Fails
**Problem:** Sui transaction fails

**Solutions:**
1. Check gas budget is sufficient (Enoki sponsors gas for zkLogin users)
2. Verify object IDs are correct
3. Ensure wallet has enough SUI (or Enoki gas pool is funded)
4. Check if objects are shared/immutable correctly
